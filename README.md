A generator for professional README.md files, generated from the command line

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our eighth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to create our own professional README generator. The project, itself, is pretty cut and dry. Users can access the application via the command line using Node.JS, then fill out the series of questions with the content they want for the README, and finally, the README is generated in the "output" folder.

This project was initially challenging, as I wasn't quite sure where to begin. Fortunately, we had spent the week studying Node.JS and I was eventually able to figure out how to link the index.js file to the .js file that generates the README markdown. This project helped me realize the capabilities of Node.JS, how it's able to provide interactivity between multiple javascript files, and how it can be leveraged from the command line terminal.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the repository into your IDE of choice and then open the index.js file using node.js.

### Usage
This application is free to use,

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and tutors from UC Berkeley.
