# svg-logo-creator

A node.js command-line application for generating svg logo files.

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our eighth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to create our own svg logo generator. The project is straightforward and will generate a .svg logo in response to user prompts. Users can access the application via the command line using Node.JS, then fill out the series of questions with the content the design and text they want for their .svg logo, and finally, the svg file is generated in the "output" folder.

In hindsight, the project seems quite simple, but knowing where to start was initially difficult. Eventually, I realized that I needed to start with creating my basic classes, which I would then extend to incorporate further use cases e.g. starting with a "shape" class, then adding individual classes for each shape - "circle," "square," etc. The project helped me further understand the concept of classes and object-oriented programming.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the repository into your IDE of choice and then open the index.js file using node.js.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and tutors from UC Berkeley.
